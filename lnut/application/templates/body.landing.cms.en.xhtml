<p>Languagenut has been designed to support primary school teachers in the delivery of Key Stage 2 Modern Foreign Languages. Covering the full four years, and linked to the KS2 Framework For Languages' objectives, Languagenut unlocks the business of learning languages in a way that is rigorous, progressive and fun.</p>

<p>Aware that the teaching and learning of French, Spanish or German can be something of an overwhelming experience, Languagenut is as child-friendly and accessible as it could possibly be. Using song and seven tried-and-tested game formats, we have created a site that is time saving, engaging, rich with virtual resources and, for adults and children alike, wonderfully stress free.</p>
